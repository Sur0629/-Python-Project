Analyzed individual player performances and overall team statistics.
Trend Analysis:

Analyzed historical trends in team performance across different tournaments.
Investigated seasonal patterns and key factors influencing match outcomes.
Visualization:

Created comprehensive visualizations to display match results, player stats, and team performances.
Used bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heat maps for effective data representation.
Insights and Recommendations:

Derived insights into top-performing players and teams.
Identified strategic patterns and key contributors to winning matches.
Provided actionable recommendations for teams based on data analysis.
Tools and Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and visualization
